## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
svg {
  margin-right: 0.3rem;
  vertical-align: sub;
}
```

I don't use vertical-align a lot, so it took me some time to find the proper solution for the svg inside the button.

```css
letter-spacing: 4px;
line-height: 1.4;
```

Just dropping there for the future some useful text properties.
